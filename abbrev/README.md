# Welcome to the State Abbreviation Game!

For a breif period of time in my work, I dealt heavily with state names and their abbreviations. Many abbreviations are unique to a state since there are no other states that begin with the first character and contain the second one (e.x. NV aka Nevada, no other states beginning with an 'N' contain a 'v'). After trying and failing to guess the code for a state that does NOT have a unique abbreviation (looking at you, states that begin with 'M'), I thought it would be fun to make a game to test one's abilty to guess state abbreviations. The results may surprise you.
